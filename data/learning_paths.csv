2 – Push and Pull Dynamics,Onboarding week,"Icecat has two ways of accepting and sharing data. These are called pull and push. 
Through pull, someone fetches data from the source of the data (or an outsourced source, such as Icecat). Through push, someone gets the data delivered to their environment.

The whole process is quite similar to the supermarket and consumer relationships. Nowadays, consumers can buy the product from the supermarket (pull) or get it delivered to its address once they share all the delivery specifications (push).

From Icecat's perspective, the process starts with brands, which are the data source. Once brands share their data with us, Icecat standardises and distributes them to content channels.",,Untitled-3-2.jpg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/45/45/1757880000000/eETF4LbbP4U15BCq0rZ4Ow/Kgts6YeBEdqHG5nn15CmXzvpEhgKu1lf82B8t6xSrZgnttuXLP9C35NdwTtFdVSJXLM1MBEK71ZHu9llHbdmH30YtlxPIsJ34w9C-0fA9WutTIgbwENJTcEYsrv4MKXu6bgLwxGJ1AK9_T_ZJ9fz8g/gb7ul7s14ut604mAIiFeL138Ud0kTcCh5uOpBO7om0Q),Yagiz Cekic,,,,
